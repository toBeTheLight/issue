Before version of 2.5.14, keyboard events with modifiers (e.g, keydown@enter, keydown@up) will not be fired when user has not ended composition (compositionend event). After version of 2.5.14 it will. And the keyboard arrow keys are usually be used to choose the right word, so this change will result in a lot of extra events.
